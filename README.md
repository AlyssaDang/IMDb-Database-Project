Replace: imdb.cfj1htplvy5o.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com  with yours, you can find this under your database information
Replace: the username as well


In Java Replace:
   // JDBC driver name and database URL
   static final String JDBC_DRIVER = "org.postgresql.Driver";  
   static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:postgresql://db-315.cse.tamu.edu/hnpatel97_db";
   static final String USER = "hnpatel97";
   static final String PASS = "*******";
  
  With
   static final String JDBC_DRIVER = "org.postgresql.Driver";  
   static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:postgresql://imdb.cfj1htplvy5o.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com/imdb";
   static final String USER = "alyssadng1";
   static final String PASS = "*******";
